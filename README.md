# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This Machine Learning project predicts a person's salary based on their years of experience using **Simple Linear Regression**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the complete ML workflow:

* Data loading
* Data visualization
* Model training
* Prediction
* Evaluation

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains:

* **YearsExperience** → Independent variable
* **Salary** → Target variable

Small dataset used for learning and demonstration purposes.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

We used **Linear Regression**:

Salary = m × Experience + c

The model learns the best fit line to predict salary.

---

## 📈 Model Visualization

The red line represents predicted salary growth trend.

---

## 📉 Evaluation Metrics

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* R² Score

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the notebook

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
jupyter notebook
```

## 🔮 Example Prediction

Input:
Years of Experience = 5

Output:
Predicted Salary ≈ 73,000+

---

## 📚 Learning Outcome
